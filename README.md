# AI/ML From Scratch

A "Pa-ir-ent Programming Adventure with my (now) 13-yo, exploring concepts in machine learning and artificial intelligence from concepts and tools to hands-on projects. The goal is use freely available tools and resources, and publish our learnings in a blog for later recall, and to help others.

## Plan

The plan is to approach this on three levels:

 * `Fundamentals` = learn basic terminology and concepts for machine learning and artificial intelligence by doing relevant courses or exploring online resources.
 * `Projects` = apply learning by doing relevant projects using various hardware and software platforms available, starting with [MIT Scratch](https://mit.scratch.edu) and [Micro:Bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/tutorials/) and building up to Python, JavaScript and RaspberryPi/Arduino.
 * `Website` = write up our learnings in regular blog posts and tutorials on an associated website. This helps reinforce learning and potentially helps others following similar journeys.

We'll look at this in three sections:
 * Fundamentals = learning the basics of machine learning and AI from concepts to code
 * Projects = creating meaningful projects to help us learn by doing - using 
 * Tutorials = sharing our insights with others by writing blog posts and creating step-by-step tutorials

> HAPPY LEARNING TRAILS! ðŸ¤–
