Welcome to the _AI From Scratch_ website and blog. 

This a pair programming and collaborative learning project from me (Nitya, the parent) and my son (AJ, the middle-schooler) as we attempt to explore the fascinating world of machine learning and artificial intelligence in a youth-friendly way.

We're still setting things up so do come back later to see our progress.
