# AI/ML From Scratch

Hi - welcome to our _AI/ML From Scratch_ - site where we share our learning adventures into machine learning and artificial intelligence with a focus on tools and tutorials suitable for middle and high school students.

## The Learners

This is a _Pairent Programming_ project collaboration between [Nitya](https://github.com/nitya) and [AJ](https://github.com/ajcreates). 
 * Nitya is a developer advocate with 20+ years of experience in technology research and development. She's a little bit JavaScript and works on a MacBook Pro.
 * AJ is a middle-schooler (at present), with experience building with Lego Mindstorms. He's a little bit Python, and works on a MacBook Air.

We are both relatively new to using [micro:bit](https://www.microbit.org/) and have used [MIT Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) in the past but not worked with their [AI Blocks](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/ai-blocks/) and [Curriculum](https://raise.mit.edu). This is an attempt to learn about AI/ML from core concepts to coded projects, _one block at a time_.

## The Plan

The goal is to approach this as a 3-part exercise, where we try to understand a concept in theory, then practice it in a simple project, then write what we learned (or how we built something) in a tutorial or blog post.

| | |
|:--|:--|
| Fundamentals | learn basic terminology and concepts for machine learning and artificial intelligence by doing relevant courses or exploring online resources. |
| Projects | apply learning by doing relevant projects using various hardware and software platforms available, starting with [MIT Scratch](https://mit.scratch.edu) and [Micro:Bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/tutorials/) and building up to Python, JavaScript and RaspberryPi/Arduino. |
| Tutorials | write up our learnings in regular blog posts and tutorials on an associated website. This helps reinforce learning and potentially helps others following similar journeys. |

## The Roadmap

Stay tuned. We'll update this section as we go, listing tutorials and resources we use for a strucutured learning approach.
