# AI/ML From Scratch

A "Pa-ir-ent Programming Adventure with my (now) 13-yo, exploring concepts in machine learning and artificial intelligence from concepts and tools to hands-on projects. The goal is use freely available tools and resources, and publish our learnings in a blog for later recall, and to help others.


## The Plan

The goal is to approach this as a 3-part exercise, where we try to understand a concept in theory, then practice it in a simple project, then write what we learned (or how we built something) in a tutorial or blog post.

|:--|:--|
| Fundamentals | learn basic terminology and concepts for machine learning and artificial intelligence by doing relevant courses or exploring online resources. |
| Projects | apply learning by doing relevant projects using various hardware and software platforms available, starting with [MIT Scratch](https://mit.scratch.edu) and [Micro:Bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/tutorials/) and building up to Python, JavaScript and RaspberryPi/Arduino. |
| Tutorials | write up our learnings in regular blog posts and tutorials on an associated website. This helps reinforce learning and potentially helps others following similar journeys. |
