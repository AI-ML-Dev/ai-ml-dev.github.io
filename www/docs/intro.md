# Setup

This section is for tutorials we've put together as we learn. We'll link to the original tutorial sources where relevant, and write up _our_ insights or experiences in walking through them in this section. 

Before we start the learning journey, let's set up our computers with relevant software and hardware libraries and validate them with a relevant _Getting Started_ guide. This is our current plan. Stay tuned for blog posts and detailed tutorials.

| Environment | Description| My Tutorial |
