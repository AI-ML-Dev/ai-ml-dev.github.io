## Connect Code Editor

You can use one of two coding environments - _desktop (Mac or PC)_ over a wired USB2.0 connection, or _mobile (Android or iOS)_ over a wireless Bluetooth connection. Use [this guide](https://www.microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/set-up/) to setup your preferred approach.

Transferring a program from the editor to the micro:bit is called _flashing_. Simply code the program on an editor like [Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/), then flash it to device by _downloading_ `.hex` file to the `MICROBITS` folder (see bottom left of editor)

Note that in modern browsers that support _webUSB_ (e.g., Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge), you may see the above `New` prompt. This indicats the web browser can connect directly over USB to micro:bit _without user intervention_. Now, reflashing is as easy as making changes to code and clicking _download._

## Connect From Mobile

_Alternatively_ you can download the `Micro:bit` mobile app from Android and iOS stores. It provides options to use wireless Bluetooth and:
 * `Discover` micro:bit devices nearby
 * `Pair` with a discovered device
 * `Create` code via onscreen editor
 * `Flash` code to paired device

However, the coding syntax and semantics are exactly the same in both cases. Pick your connection option - then let's start programming the micro:bit and learning the coding blocks to work with the various sensors and I/O capabilities.

In the remaining part of today's exercises, we'll be using a _desktop_ connection (on MacOS) over _webUSB_ (on the Edge browser). We'll go through these tutorials in order:

 * [LEDs and Buttons](https://www.microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/leds-and-buttons/)
 * [Sensors](https://www.microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/sensors/)
 * [Sound output](https://www.microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/sound-output/)
 * [Sound input](https://www.microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/sound-input/)
 * [Radio and pins](https://www.microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/radio-and-pins/)

Yaay! We got the basic tour of all micro:bit features and managed to code something simple to use each one - giving us familiarity with the relevant blocks and workflows. Next, let's dive deeper into using MakeCode and try a couple of advanced projects.
