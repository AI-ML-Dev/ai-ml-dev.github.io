1. Creative Projects

The [First Steps](https://www.microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/get-creative/) tutorial ends by recommending three creative projects to explore. The first two need 2 micro:bit devices to complete.
 * [Proximity Beacon](https://www.microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/proximity-beacon/?editor=makecode) - alert when devices are in proximity.
 * [Pressure Switch Alarm](https://www.microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/pressure-switch-alarm/?editor=makecode) - alert when user steps on pressure pad.
 * [Reaction Game](https://www.microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/reaction-game/?editor=makecode) - create a game with DIY switches as inputs.

We'll try out the third project (with one micro:bit) first before going on to explore the [MakeCode site](https://makecode.microbit.org/) for more tutorials.
